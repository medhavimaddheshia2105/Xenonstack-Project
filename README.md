# Xenonstack-project

### Hi I am MEDHAVI!
### Readme file content of Secrets-
The project is based on a sample website where a user can keep his secrets stored.
The website is connected to the database and all the credentials get saved there.
To start the project we go to the project directory in the command prompt and  give the command “node app.js” here app.js is the Javascript executable file which starts the development server and directs us to localhost 3000 from there we can acess the website.
The website also has a key functionality as the user can also login to his account with his google account, this has been managed in the backend with the help of tokens.
The project has extensive use of node js and database.
